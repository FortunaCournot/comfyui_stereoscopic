## Summary

This package includes custom_nodes, workflows for ComfyUI, and shellscripts git bash.
It was developed by me, Fortuna, and Iablunoshka, who is responsible for the insane speed of the algorithm. We did this in the hope, that we soon see more VR content, AI or classic.

The custom nodes and workflows simply the process of converting images and videos to full side-by-side (FSBS) that can be viewed in VR glasses (e.g. Meta Quest or HTC Vive) or glasses on 3D Monitors.

Our work on the asset is based on the great work of Sam Seen from ComfyUI_SSStereoscope, that gave us a good starting point. I want also to say "thank you!" to all the creators that gave us the opportunity to propagate the potential of this tool through their artwork.

VR we are!
